#👋 Hi, I’m Thomas John Gough (aka @Readyray7513)
👀 Passionate about data science, AI, and automation.
🌱 Currently learning Python, SQL, Power BI, and machine learning.
🤝 Open to collaborating on AI projects, data-driven apps, and anything that sharpens my problem-solving and coding skills.
📫 Reach me via GitHub or email — always open to connecting and building cool things.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I can debug code faster than most people can Google the error message.
🚀 Right now, I’m working through CS50x, CS50P, and CS50SQL, building a movie recommender system, and expanding my AI development toolkit.
